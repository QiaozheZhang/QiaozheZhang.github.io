I am a Ph.D. student at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jun Sun]({% include url/jun_sun.md %}) and [Prof. Yingzhuang Liu](https://hust.teacher.360eol.com/teacherBasic/preview?teacherType=&teacherId=15939). 

Previously, I received my B.Eng degree (2014-2018) in Electronic Information Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/).

# Research Interests

My research interests broadly lie in the theoretical understanding of deep learning models. I am particularly fascinated by simple yet principled approaches that can shed light on the fundamental capabilities and limitations of modern models. I am motivated by questions that bridge theory and practice, aiming to build frameworks that not only explain why current methods work but also guide the design of future ones.

These days, I am mostly drawn by three interrelated directions: model compression and capacity, generalization, and robustness. These aspects are central to both the efficiency and reliability of deep learning, and I am especially interested in developing theoretical tools that help us better understand the trade-offs between them.
