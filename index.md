  <div id="abstract" class="bibbox" markdown="1"><pre><code class="language-bibtex">Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be. Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure, i.e., \textit{Rényi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative Rényi entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform} (identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the \textit{Rényi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller the (Rényi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between generalization and (Rényi) sharpness, we provide several generalization bounds in terms of Rényi sharpness, by taking advantage of the reparametrization invariance property of Rényi sharpness, as well as the trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the Rényi sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of Rényi Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., Rényi Sharpness Aware Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5%, compared against the classical SAM method.</code></pre></div>

  <div id="abstract" class="bibbox" markdown="1"><pre><code class="language-bibtex">Network pruning is a commonly used measure to alleviate the storage and computational burden of deep neural networks. However, the fundamental limit of network pruning is still lacking. To close the gap, in this work we'll take a first-principles approach, i.e. we'll directly impose the sparsity constraint on the loss function and leverage the framework of statistical dimension in convex geometry, thus enabling us to characterize the sharp phase transition point, which can be regarded as the fundamental limit of the pruning ratio. Through this limit, we're able to identify two key factors that determine the pruning ratio limit, namely, weight magnitude and network sharpness. Generally speaking, the flatter the loss landscape or the smaller the weight magnitude, the smaller pruning ratio. Moreover, we provide efficient countermeasures to address the challenges in the computation of the pruning limit, which mainly involves the accurate spectrum estimation of a large-scale and non-positive Hessian matrix. Moreover, through the lens of the pruning ratio threshold, we can also provide rigorous interpretations on several heuristics in existing pruning algorithms. Extensive experiments are performed which demonstrate that our theoretical pruning ratio threshold coincides very well with the experiments.</code></pre></div>

  <div id="abstract" class="bibbox" markdown="1"><pre><code class="language-bibtex">Whole slide image (WSI) refers to a type of high-resolution scanned tissue image, which is extensively employed in computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD). The extremely high resolution and limited availability of region-level annotations make employing deep learning methods for WSI-based digital diagnosis challenging. Recently integrating multiple instance learning (MIL) and Transformer for WSI analysis shows very promising results. However, designing effective Transformers for this weakly-supervised high-resolution image analysis is an underexplored yet important problem. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level MIL (MMIL) scheme by introducing a hierarchical structure to MIL, which enables efficient handling of MIL tasks involving a large number of instances. Based on MMIL, we instantiated MMIL-Transformer, an efficient Transformer model with windowed exact self-attention for large-scale MIL tasks. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted a set of experiments on WSI classification tasks, where MMIL-Transformer demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 96.80% test AUC and 97.67% test accuracy on the CAMELYON16 dataset, 99.04% test AUC and 94.37% test accuracy on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset, respectively.</code></pre></div>
